 - I'd to building microservices with ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/code-TypeScript-informational?style=flat&logo=typescript&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) & ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/code-Nestjs-informational?style=flat&logo=nestjs&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) on ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/code-Node.js-informational?style=flat&logo=node.js&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a). Before TS I was using ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/code-JavaScript-informational?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a).
 - And I am also capable to do some front-end staff via ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/front-Next.js-informational?style=flat&logo=next.js&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) which is based on ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/front-React-informational?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a).
 - I am related with a #crypto a way before ETH networks domination. As a results you won't suprise me with all the ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/web3-Web_3-informational?style=flat&logo=web3dotjs&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) stuff like smart-contracts on ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/web3-Solidity-informational?style=flat&logo=solidity&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) or testing and deploying Dapps within Mainnet ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/web3-ETH-informational?style=flat&logo=ethereum&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) or it's test-nets. So does with ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/web3-IPFS-informational?style=flat&logo=ipfs&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a)
 - Using ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/OS-Windows%2011-informational?style=flat&logo=windows&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) OS on my home PC, ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/OS-Ubuntu-informational?style=flat&logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) on server machines and my working laptop is Mac with ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/OS-MacOS-informational?style=flat&logo=macos&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a).
 - As a OS CLI I prefer using ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/shell-Windows_Terminal-informational?style=flat&logo=windowsterminal&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) and ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/shell-Powershell-informational?style=flat&logo=powershell&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) profile above all other, mainly because of C#-like syntax, but other CLI interfaces are pretty cool.
 - I have a personal license for ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/IDE-WebStorm-informational?style=flat&logo=webstorm&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) as IDE, and as Code Editor Microsoft's open-source ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/editor-VSC-informational?style=flat&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) is quite amazing. 
 - My favorite NoSQL DB is ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/DB-MongoDB-informational?style=flat&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) and for a full text-search ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/DB-Elasticsearch-informational?style=flat&logo=elasticsearch&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a). Amoung GraphDBs ‚Äî ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/DB-Neo4j-informational?style=flat&logo=neo4j&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) and as usual: ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/DB-Posgresql-informational?style=flat&logo=posgresql&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) for relation-oriented scenarios. ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/DB-Redis-informational?style=flat&logo=redis&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) as in-memory storage.
 - For DB analytics purposes I found ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/DBA-Datagrip-informational?style=flat&logo=datagrip&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) very useful & for Mongo management I take ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/DBA-Mongo_Compass-informational?style=flat&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a).
 - Amoung VCS I am expirienced with ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/VCS-git-informational?style=flat&logo=git&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) and such providers as: ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/VCS-github-informational?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a), ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/VCS-gitlab-informational?style=flat&logo=gitlab&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) and ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/VCS-bitbucket-informational?style=flat&logo=bitbucket&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) including their git merging strategies.
  - As canban-boards and task-managers, I am fine with both Atlassian's: ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tools-Jira-informational?style=flat&logo=jira&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) & ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tools-Trello-informational?style=flat&logo=trello&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a). Well ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tools-Redmine-informational?style=flat&logo=redmine&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) is also an options, but... it have so many butts. #IfYouKnowWhatImean
  - Using ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/JQM-Bull-informational?style=flat&logo=bullmq&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) as job queue managers and ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/MB-RabbitMQ-informational?style=flat&logo=rabbitmq&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) as message broker.
  - I don't care much about tests ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tests-Jest-informational?style=flat&logo=jest&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a), ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tests-Mocha-informational?style=flat&logo=mocha&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) & ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tests-Jasmine-informational?style=flat&logo=jasmine&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) since I am not a big fun of TDD (test-driven development, where you write testes, before the code).
  - As for DevOps I'd like to use ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Containder-Docker-informational?style=flat&logo=docker&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) as container software and deploy things via ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/CD-GitHub_Actions-informational?style=flat&logo=githubactions&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) and manage my clusters via ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/CD-Portainer-informational?style=flat&logo=portainer&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) sometimes use direct deployment by ssh & sftp.
