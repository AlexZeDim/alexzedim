 - I am building microservices with ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/code-Node.js-informational?style=flat&logo=node.js&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) and ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/code-JavaScript-informational?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) (or ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/code-TypeScript-informational?style=flat&logo=typescript&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) with ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/code-Nestjs-informational?style=flat&logo=nestjs&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a)) 
 - But I am also capable to do some front-end staff via ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/front-Next.js-informational?style=flat&logo=next.js&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) which is based on ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/front-React-informational?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) 
 - Using ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/OS-Windows%2010-informational?style=flat&logo=windows&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) OS on my home PC, but I am also familiar with ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/OS-Ubuntu-informational?style=flat&logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a)
 - As a CLI I prefer ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/shell-Powershell-informational?style=flat&logo=powershell&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) over ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/shell-bash-informational?style=flat&logo=gnu-bash&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) because of methods and C#-like syntax.
 - I choose ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/IDE-WebStorm-informational?style=flat&logo=webstorm&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) as IDE, and ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/editor-VSC-informational?style=flat&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) as Code Editor.
 - as NoSQL DB I prefer ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/DB-MongoDB-informational?style=flat&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) and as RDBS ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/DB-Postgres-informational?style=flat&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a). Still such things as ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/DB-Neo4j-informational?style=flat&logo=neo4j&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) and ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/DB-Cassandra-informational?style=flat&logo=apache-cassandra&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) I want to try in the future.
 - Amoung VCS I am expirienced with ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/VCS-git-informational?style=flat&logo=git&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) and such providers as: ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/VCS-github-informational?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a), ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/VCS-gitlab-informational?style=flat&logo=gitlab&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) and ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/VCS-bitbucket-informational?style=flat&logo=bitbucket&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) including their git merging strategies.
  - As canban-boards and task-managers, I am fine with both Atlassian's: ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tools-Jira-informational?style=flat&logo=jira&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) & ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tools-Trello-informational?style=flat&logo=trello&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a)
  - ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/PM-PM2-informational?style=flat&logo=pm2&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) as process manager, ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/JQM-Bull-informational?style=flat&logo=bullmq&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) or ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/JQM-Agenda-informational?style=flat&logo=agendajs&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) as job queue managers and ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/MB-RabbitMQ-informational?style=flat&logo=rabbitmq&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) as message broker.

  - I'm using ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Containder-Docker-informational?style=flat&logo=docker&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) as container software and sometimes use direct deployment by ssh/
