Hello there!

My name is Sasha. 

I am a back-end node.js dev but I'm also capable of doing some front-end staff via SSR framework of React, called Next.js.

Most of my open source projects are relevant with World of Warcraft, so if you are looking for any advice or just want to contact me use Discord: `AlexZeDim#2645`

You may also find me on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/7475615/alexzedim)
